# Abstract
Chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration, a vital indicator of water quality and crucial for assessing the health of marine ecosystems, presents significant challenges for satellite remote sensing due to various interferences, such as cloud cover, sun-glints, and adjacency effects. These impediments limit our understanding of marine ecosystems and hinder sustainable management practices. This study proposes a novel approach to overcome these challenges: the Fourier transform convolutional long short-term memory (FTC-LSTM) framework. Integrating Fourier transform convolution (FTC) and long short-term memory (LSTM) layers, the FTC-LSTM model aims to estimate cloud-free Chl a, improving the accuracy and robustness of the inpainting process. Evaluation of the FTC-LSTM model across the South China Sea (SCS), along with two other state-of-the-art deep learning models [data-interpolating convolutional auto-encoder (DINCAE) and convolutional long short-term memory neural network (Conv-LSTM)], reveals its consistently superior performance across regions with distinct characteristics. Notably, the FTC-LSTM model achieved the highest scores with impressive values: 0.95 for determination coefficient ( R2 ), 47.57 for peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), 0.99 for structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and 0.01 for root mean square error (RMSE). The temporal analysis demonstrates the modelâ€™s ability to accurately capture the temporal variability of Chl a in the SCS. Furthermore, a comparison of spatial patterns indicates that the FTC-LSTM model excels in reliably reconstructing Chl a distributions within the SCS, outperforming other models, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions significantly impacted by clouds.
